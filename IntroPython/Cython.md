Cython 
============
The Cython programming language is a superset of Python with a foreign function interface for invoking C/C++ routines and 
the ability to declare the static type of subroutine parameters and results, local variables, and class attributes.
It actually is a Python to C source code translator that integrates with the CPython interpreter on a low-level.
