GIS with Python
===================
Shapely and Fiona are essential Python tools for geospatial programming written by Sean Gillies. 

### Shapely

Shapely does manipulating and analyzing data.

With Shapely, you can do things like buffers, unions, intersections, centroids, convex hulls, and lots more.

### Fiona

Fiona does reading and writing data formats. For this it uses OGR, the most popular open-source conversion system. OGR is extremely powerful and supports many, many formats - itâ€™s used by Mapnik, a tile rendering engine, to support more types of data, 
and used by people like me every day to convert formats.
