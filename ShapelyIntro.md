Deterministic spatial analysis is an important component of computational approaches to problems in agriculture, ecology, epidemiology, sociology, and many other fields. What is the surveyed perimeter/area ratio of these patches of animal habitat? Which properties in this town intersect with the 50-year flood contour from this new flooding model? What are the extents of findspots for ancient ceramic wares with maker’s marks “A” and “B”, and where do the extents overlap? What’s the path from home to office that best skirts identified zones of location based spam? These are just a few of the possible questions addressable using non-statistical spatial analysis, and more specifically, computational geometry.

Shapely is a Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library. GEOS, a port of the Java Topology Suite (JTS), is the geometry engine of the PostGIS spatial extension for the PostgreSQL RDBMS. The designs of JTS and GEOS are largely guided by the Open Geospatial Consortium‘s Simple Features Access Specification [1] and Shapely adheres mainly to the same set of standard classes and operations. Shapely is thereby deeply rooted in the conventions of the geographic information systems (GIS) world, but aspires to be equally useful to programmers working on non-conventional problems.

The first premise of Shapely is that Python programmers should be able to perform PostGIS type geometry operations outside of an RDBMS. Not all geographic data originate or reside in a RDBMS or are best processed using SQL. We can load data into a spatial RDBMS to do work, but if there’s no mandate to manage (the “M” in “RDBMS”) the data over time in the database we’re using the wrong tool for the job. The second premise is that the persistence, serialization, and map projection of features are significant, but orthogonal problems. You may not need a hundred GIS format readers and writers or the multitude of State Plane projections, and Shapely doesn’t burden you with them. The third premise is that Python idioms trump GIS (or Java, in this case, since the GEOS library is derived from JTS, a Java project) idioms.

If you enjoy and profit from idiomatic Python, appreciate packages that do one thing well, and agree that a spatially enabled RDBMS is often enough the wrong tool for your computational geometry job, Shapely might be for you.

Spatial Data Model
The fundamental types of geometric objects implemented by Shapely are points, curves, and surfaces. Each is associated with three sets of (possibly infinite) points in the plane. The interior, boundary, and exterior sets of a feature are mutually exclusive and their union coincides with the entire plane [2].

A Point has an interior set of exactly one point, a boundary set of exactly no points, and an exterior set of all other points. A Point has a topological dimension of 0.
A Curve has an interior set consisting of the infinitely many points along its length (imagine a Point dragged in space), a boundary set consisting of its two end points, and an exterior set of all other points. A Curve has a topological dimension of 1.
A Surface has an interior set consisting of the infinitely many points within (imagine a Curve dragged in space to cover an area), a boundary set consisting of one or more Curves, and an exterior set of all other points including those within holes that might exist in the surface. A Surface has a topological dimension of 2.
That may seem a bit esoteric, but will help clarify the meanings of Shapely’s spatial predicates, and it’s as deep into theory as this manual will go. Consequences of point-set theory, including some that manifest themselves as “gotchas”, for different classes will be discussed later in this manual.

The point type is implemented by a Point class; curve by the LineString and LinearRing classes; and surface by a Polygon class. Shapely implements no smooth (i.e. having continuous tangents) curves. All curves must be approximated by linear splines. All rounded patches must be approximated by regions bounded by linear splines.

Collections of points are implemented by a MultiPoint class, collections of curves by a MultiLineString class, and collections of surfaces by a MultiPolygon class. These collections aren’t computationally significant, but are useful for modeling certain kinds of features. A Y-shaped line feature, for example, is well modeled as a whole by a MultiLineString.

The standard data model has additional constraints specific to certain types of geometric objects that will be discussed in following sections of this manual.

See also http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/discussion.htm#spatialDataModel for more illustrations of this data model.

Relationships
The spatial data model is accompanied by a group of natural language relationships between geometric objects – contains, intersects, overlaps, touches, etc. – and a theoretical framework for understanding them using the 3x3 matrix of the mutual intersections of their component point sets [2]: the DE-9IM. A comprehensive review of the relationships in terms of the DE-9IM is found in [4] and will not be reiterated in this manual.

Operations
Following the JTS technical specs [5], this manual will make a distinction between constructive (buffer, convex hull) and set-theoretic operations (intersection, union, etc.). The individual operations will be fully described in a following section of the manual.

Coordinate Systems
Even though the Earth is not flat – and for that matter not exactly spherical – there are many analytic problems that can be approached by transforming Earth features to a Cartesian plane, applying tried and true algorithms, and then transforming the results back to geographic coordinates. This practice is as old as the tradition of accurate paper maps.

Shapely does not support coordinate system transformations. All operations on two or more features presume that the features exist in the same Cartesian plane.
